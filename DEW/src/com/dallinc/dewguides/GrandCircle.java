The state's elevation ranges from a low of 470 ft, near Laughlin, to 13,145 ft at Boundary Peak. \n\nNevada became a state in 1864 during the Civil War. The Union did not want riches from Nevada's mines going to aid the Confederacy. And so the \"Silver State\" was battle born.";	
		public final String LASVEGAS = "Las Vegas, Spanish for the Meadows was a green area around an artesian spring in the Mojave Desert.  Travelers, beginning with the nomadic Archaic People, for at least 10,000 years, have used this natural spring.  Las Vegas became a stop over point for the Spanish trail in the 1830fs.   In 1855 it became a Mormon settlement and a mission and fort were established.  The Mormons abandoned it a few years later due to the harsh conditions and extreme temperatures. \n\n Following the departure of the Mormons, the area was used for ranching.  The Gass family owned rancho Las Vegas until 1883, when they sold to Helen Stewart.  Helen Stewart ran the ranch by herself for 20 years after her husband was killed in a feud with a neighboring ranch.     \n\n The San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt lake Railroad purchased the ranch from Stewart in 1903 for $50,000.  In 1905 a two-day auction of lots was held and 1200 town lots were sold for $265,000 and the town was established.  Soon, frame structures were built and the train began making stops here.  Hotels, saloons brothels, and gambling dens also sprang up.  Gambling was eventually outlawed in 1910. \n\n From 1910 until 1930 the town went into depression, with nothing to break up the monotony but the occasional train stop.  In 1931 the building of Hoover Dam in Black Canyon, 31 miles from Vegas, brought laborers, truckers, government officials and engineers by the hundreds.  In one year the population doubled from 5000 to over 10,000.  That same year gambling became legal again. \n\n In the 50fs there was also above ground nuclear testing in the desert north of Las Vegas.  Between 1951 and 1955 The US Government detonated 45 atomic devices at the Nevada Proving Grounds, now known as the Nevada Test Site.  At times, mushroom clouds were visible from downtown.  In the 60fs 70fs and 80fs, hundreds of nuclear tests were conducted underground.  Currently, nuclear tests are conducted at the sub-critical level.";

It was soon followed by the El Rancho, which is often referred to as the first built on the Strip.  In 1946 Benjamin gBugsyh Siegel went out into the desert far beyond the El Rancho and began to build an immense luxury hotel and Casino.\n\n It was a tremendous undertaking at a time when it was hard to get materials at the end of the war.  People said he was crazy.  Bugsyfs Pink Flamingo was also the first financed by the Mafia from back east. But it was the first in a long line of properties controlled by organized crime figures.  During the 50fs and 60fs, roughly the mafia controlled Ninety percent of Las Vegas casinos.  Las Vegas was gopen territoryh so any crime family was allowed to invest freely.  Money from the gMobh in Galveston, Cleveland, Chicago, Atlantic City, and St. Louis poured into Las Vegas. \n\n In the late 1960fs Kirk Kerkorian and Howard Hughes began buying properties.  Gradually the influence of the mafia waned, as regular business competition arrived. \n\n In 1989, Steve Wynnfs 3000 room Mirage opened, and with it a new era of Mega Resorts.  The mirage cost 610 million and required revenue of a million a day just to keep the lights on.  It was a huge financial success.  The 3000 rooms supplied thousands of patrons for the casino.  The building spree that followed left Las Vegas with 9 of the worlds 10 largest hotels.  In 1998 the Bellagio was built on the property that formerly had the Dunes on it, for a record breaking 2.3 billion. ";

The 2011 renovation cost 50 million. \n\n Aladdin \n Built in 1966 it was the first strip hotel built since the Tropicana, 8 yrs earlier.  Elvis was married here in 1967. \n\n Caesars \n Caesars set a new standard for luxury when it was built in 1966.  It was the first gtheme g property.  Famous for its sporting events esp. Boxing.  Currently it is famous shopping.  The $250 million Forum Shops are also home of Vegasf first  (of many) celebrity chef owned restaurants, Wolfgang Puckfs SPAGO.   \n\n Las Vegas Hilton \n When International hotel opened in 1969 it replaced the Stardust as the worlds largest hotel.  Elvis made his Vegas debut, and began his comeback here the month after opening.   He played a total of 837 sold out shows until his death in 1977.  Today the Hilton is known for its 70 million Star Trek attraction.  3174 rooms. \n\n Circus Circus \n Originally a casino without a hotel, opened in 1968 Jay Sarnofs casino had elephants and trapeze acts but actually charged admission for gamblers.  In 1972 the hotel tower was built. \n\n Ballyfs \n The MGM Grand (now Ballyfs) Opened in 1973 with the worlds largest casino.  It, like the Hilton, was a Kirk Kerkorian property.  In 1980, it was the site of the second worst hotel fire in US history, in which 84 perished.  In 1985 it was purchased by Ballyfs who later sold it to Hilton, which divested its casino holdings to Park Place Entertainment.  Park Place currently owns Ballyfs, Paris, Flamingo, NY, NY, MGM, TI and Mirage. \n\n Mirage \n In 1989 the Mirage was the first resort built from scratch since 1973.  It was a 3049room, 650million dollar, mega-resort complete with a rainforest, pygmy sharks, Bengali Tigers and a 30 million dollar erupting volcano.  It completely changed the Vegas landscape and the resulting construction boom made the strip unrecognizable from the Vegas of Bugsyfs days. \n\n Excalibur \n When Completed in 1992 it was the largest hotel and largest casino in the world with 4039 rooms.  It has a medieval theme.  It is famous for its dinner and show with knights jousting in the Tournament of kings.  Excalibur also houses the cityfs largest buffet with 1049 seating capacity. \n\n Luxor \n When Luxor completed its 2000 room towers in 1993 it surpassed Excalibur as the largest hotel with 4500 rooms.  The spotlight that shines from the pyramidfs apex packs a 40 billion candle power punch.  It is rumored to be visible to pilots leaving LA. \n\n MGM \n Mere months after the Luxor was completed, it was surpassed by the new, largest hotel, the MGM with its 5005, (currently 5805) room count.  The MGM is currently the most popular venue for concerts and championship boxing bouts in the city. \n\n Monte Carlo \n Monte Carlo was the first property to be modeled after European Casinos.  Its Name and Decor are based on the Place du Casino in Monaco.  At completion it was the 7th largest Hotel with 3002 rooms. \n\n NY, NY \n Possibly the most authentic of the gthemeh properties, NY, NY houses famous restaurants and shops from the Big Apple, including Gallagherfs Steak House, and Nathans Famous. \n\n Bellagio \n When built in 1998 Bellagio was by far the most expensive property on the strip.  The Tuscan decor is extravagant even by Las Vegas standards.  The glass flowers that adorn the ceiling of the front lobby are actually individual glass sculptures created by Chihully. \n\n TI \n In 2003 TI got a huge makeover to change it from the family friendly, pirate themed resort, to an adult friendly place that makes money.  Gone are the huge arcade, skull and cross bones, and the pirate battle.  In their place, more gaming, more hip decor and a more adult friendly show gSirens of TI.h \n\n Paris \n Paris opened in September 1999, complete with a 1/2 size Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe.  It has one of, if not the, best buffets in Las Vegas.  It is divided by region, Alsace, Brittany, Burgundy etc. \n\n Mandalay Bay \n Completed in 1999 with a tropical theme, Mandalay Bay has a 12000 seat sports and entertainment complex.  It also houses the completely separate Four Seasons hotel.  The pool is the best in Vegas with a river a beach and a wave pool with 3 ft swells.  3300 rooms. \n\n Venetian \n When the Venetian was completed (including Palazzo) it became the largest property in Vegas, with       Rooms.  The Venice theme with canals and gondolas, along with brand shops, and fabulous restaurants has endeared the Venetian to an exclusive clientele. 	 \n\n Planet Hollywood \n PH opened as the Aladdin in 2000.  It was an unsuccessful venture largely because of the small size and poor layout of the casino.  It was also late to the gtheme hotel partyh and seemed a bit too cheesy for the gaming business, even in Vegas.  It has been revamped into PH, which is very hip.  The Miracle Mile shops are also a great improvement.  The Casino still needs attention. \n\n City Center \n The Newest and biggest project yet is the City Center.  It includes 4 hotels Vdara, Cosmopolitan, Mandarin and Aria.  It also has an exclusive shopping area, Crystals, with brands like Louis Vitton and Prada.";

They raised fruit and nuts also.  The city of ST. George was incorporated in 1862 and named after George A. Smith who was a prominent leader of the Mormon Church.   \n\n When the Civil war ended in 1865, and later when the Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, silk, cotton and other materials became readily available.  The cotton mission was no longer necessary or competitive.  Many of the families returned to Salt Lake City, still others stayed on and many of their descendants are still in the area.  This is part of the reason St. George still has a population of Mormons that approaches 75%.  \n\n On May 19,1953 the 32 Kiloton, gDirty Harryh bomb was detonated at the Nevada Test Site.

All of the parks we visit on this trip are within the plateau. \n\n The geology of the plateau dates back to Precambrian times.  The basement rocks of the plateau (only visible in the deepest canyons)  are the remnant of an ancient mountain range.  These metamorphic rocks range from 600 Million to almost 2 billion years old.   \n\n The plateau it self is only 20-30 million years old.  The rock layers are much older.  Over hundreds of millions of years the environment was in continual change.  \n\n There were inland seas, vast windblown deserts, swamps, qceans etc.  Sediment was deposited over millions of years.  The sedimentary layers of shale, limestone and sandstone were formed like a giant layer cake. \n\n 20 or 30 million years ago the pressure from the North American Plate colliding with the Pacific Plate (the same pressure that created the Rockies) caused the plateau to rise.  This uplift was unique because the Colorado plateau remained relatively stabile, (there was very little faulting and folding) compared to the mountain building to the north, and the stretching which created the basin and range province to the west.  The plateau retained its structural integrity as a single tectonic block. \n\n The block rose as much as 3000 meters.

It is divided into three sections, Upper Antelope Canyon, Lower Antelope Canyon, and the Powell inlet called Antelope Canyon that is only accessible by boat. \n\n Because Antelope canyon is prone to flash flooding in cases of inclement weather (especially up stream) the canyon is often closed and tours may be cancelled without notice. \n\n In August 1997 eleven tourists lost their lives in a flash flood in Lower Antelope.   At that time there was little rainfall in the area but an earlier storm had deposited lots of water in the drainage upstream. Seven French, two Swedes and two Americans perished. \n\n Antelope Canyon is a crack in the thick Navajo Sandstone layer of the Colorado Plateau.  When it rains this wash becomes a tributary of the Colorado River, although now it drains directly into Lake Powell. \n\n The Navajo layer is famous for its slot canyons.  The layer is hard enough that water cuts downward with very little of the side erosion that takes place in the softer layers.  Although Antelope is the most famous there are many spectacular slot canyons formed in  the Navajo layer, Buckskin gulch, Peek-a-boo, Canyon X, and Spooky gulch to name a few.  In reality there are hundreds. \n\n The lines on the canyon wall and in the surrounding formations often are at different angles to each other,  this phenomenon is called crossbedding.  In the Navajo layer crossbedding was caused by wind-blown sand being blown over dunes in a vast Jurassic desert about 170 million years ago.  As the water flows through Antelope, cutting downward, it polishes the sides of the canyon, making crossbedded layers appear as smooth lines.

Much of the coal was transported through pipes in a water slurry.  The use of scarce groundwater for the operation was highly controversial.  Between 1968 and 2005 over 1billion gallons of water was used to transport the B.M. coal to the Mohave generating Station in Laughlin NV.  The water table has gone down by hundreds of feet, and there is some fear of possible contamination from the mine.  In 2005 the Mohave plant, which was unable to meet new EPA requirements, shut down. \n\n The second mine on the mesa is the Kayenta Mine.  The Black Mesa and Lake Powell Railroad also transports its coal from Black Mesa to a power plant near Page.  The electric train makes two round trips daily.

In 1978 the last stretch (Kingman- Ash Fork) was finished and Seligman was bypassed as well. \n\n Overnight Seligmanfs traffic went from 9000 cars per day to 50.  Eventually the train quit stopping too.  It seemed that Seligman was destined to fade away.  In 1988 the Barber in Seligman, Angel Delgadillo, called a meeting in Seligman and in a way kept Seligman on the map. \n\n Historic Route 66 \n Angel saw the world pass Seligman by and it made him mad.  He did not want to see his life long town become a ghost town.  At the meeting they discussed the importance of the old highway, not just as means of commerce for the town, but also as a reminder of the history of the west.  They started the Historic Route 66 Association of Arizona.  And began the movement that led to the eventual designation of RTE. 66 as an historic highway (the first designated as such).  Angelfs Barbershop has become the Route 66 Visitors Center and Gift Shop.  It is a Mecca for Route 66 enthusiasts worldwide.  Angel has been interview hundreds of times, received many awards and has been on TV in many countries.  He has been on Japanese TV 5 or 6 times, most recently with Yamashita Tomohisa (Yamapi).

		public final String RT66 = "RTE. 66 was established in 1926 as part of the US highway system.  It followed roughly, what had been called the National Old Trails Highway.  The highway went from Missouri to Santa Monica.  The route became the main artery for auto travelers going west from the 1930fs until the 1970fs.  It has been popularized in song and on film and is part of Americasf collective consciousness. \n\n The first travelers to utilize the new highway were the Dust Bowl refugees, Okies and Arkies on exodus to find a new gpromised landh in California.  Their experience is captured in John Steinbeckfs gthe Grapes of Wrathh which later became a John Ford film by the same title.  It tells the tale of the Joad family who lost their farm in Oklahoma and went to find work in California in the 1930fs.  Steinbeck grew up in Salinas and had seen the plight of the Dust Bowl refugees first hand.  These people had traveled 66 even before it was paved.  Paving was completed in 1938. \n\n Later after the War the 66 Highway was a major part of the post war boom.  Americans left the rust belt for the warm climate and growing economy out west.  The sights along the route became popular tourist attractions.   \n\n Route 66 became the inspiration for John Lassiterfs Pixar film gCarsh.  In fact the town Radiator Springs in the movie was based on Seligman AZ, according to Lassiter, who met and spent time with Angel and Juan Delgadillo. \n\n Now Route 66 carries the nostalgia of less hurried era gone by.  It is especially loved by those baby boomers that remember traveling west on 66 as youngsters, or they remember watching the TV show in the 60fs.";

He was also commissioned to test the feasibility for the use of camels as pack animals for the cavalry in the US southwest.  In 1859 the road was built.  In the 1870fs rich mining claims were established in the area.   Lewis Kingman came to survey a route for the railroad in 1880.  Eventually, Kingman was established in 1882 as a railroad town.   However, most of the growth in the early days was a result of the mining boom. In the first half of the 20th century Kingman grew in spurts, gold strikes, Hoover Dam, WW2 Airfield and gunnery school etc.   In 1939 Clark Gable and Carol Lombard were married in Kingmanfs St. Johns Church. Kingmanfs most famous son was the actor Andy Devine, and old Rte. 66 bears his name through Kingman.   \n\n Kingman is a famous stop on Rte. 66, and is one of the towns mentioned in Bobby Troupefs song gget your kicks on Rte. 66.h  The section of 66 from Kingman to Ash Fork is the longest remaining section of 66, and is host to the Annual 66 Fun Run the first weekend in May. \n\n In 1992 Pamela Anderson did one of her Playboy photo shoots in Kingman, and was brought in to the Police station for indecent exposure.

The 1870fs were peak production for Chloride (named for silver chloride) with over 75 mines in operation and a population that exceeded 5000.  In the 1940fs silver mining was discouraged as unnecessary to the war effort.

The water behind the dam forms Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US. Even though the Dam was named after Herbert Hoover his political rival, FDR and his Secretary of the Interior, continually called it gBoulder Damh and because FDRfs presidency lasted over a decade the name gBoulder Damh became common.   \n\n During the construction period 112 people died in accidents, but contrary to rumor, none are entombed in the cement of the dam.

Because of the good wages and the harsh working conditions it was feared that the workers would gamble with their wages and not work.
