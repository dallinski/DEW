Williams was a tall skinny red head with a high squeaky voice.  He was battle scarred and weather beaten.   He rode with short stirrups so his knees rode up near his chest.  He seemed crazy and eccentric, which may have kept him safe on his long ventures into gIndian Country so hostile no other would dare to go there.h  His drunken spree at Taos set the standard of drunken debauchery that no other could match.  When he fired gkicking Betsyh he used a technique called the gdouble wobbleh because he could not hold the gun steady for long.  However his wobbly aim was accurate.  He bet at shooting matches and never lost.   \n\n Williams wandered from Oregon to Mexico and from the Mississippi to the Pacific.  They said he had more lives that a cat.  In 1849 his luck finally ran out and he was killed by a band of hostile Utes in Southern Colorado. \n\n The town of Williams holds a Rendevous in his honor every October.  As a tribute to Billfs legendary stamina one of the events is a 100 mile footrace. \n\n Williams has been know as the gGateway to the Grand Canyonh since the Sante Fe Railroad completed the spur to the canyon in 1901.  The train (now owned by  Xanterra, the park concessioner) now runs once to the Grand Canyon once a day every day except on Christmas. \n\n Williams was also one of the main towns on old Route 66, which followed the E-W running railroad route.  In the 1880s and 90fs Williams was a wild RR town.  The E-W HWY that follows the tracks passes by buildings that were brothels and saloons at the turn of the last century.  Some of them still have bullet holes in the walls and bars.";
		public final String FLAGSTAFF = "Flagstaff was named after a celebration of the Centennial of the US in 1876.   A local rancher reportedly flew a flag on top of a tall Ponderosa pine.  In the 1880s timber and Cattle were the mainstays of the Arizona economy and a railroad was need to ship the products.  Large government land grants enabled the railroads to lay tracks.  When the RR was completed the rail companies recouped their money by dividing grant lands and selling off lots to settlers. \n\n John W Young, son of Brigham Young, founded the Mormon Cattle Company, and stocked the range around Flagstaff on large scale for the first time.  The operation later became known as the Arizona cattle Company.  Mormon Lake south of Flagstaff was named after Youngfs group.  Young was followed by cattle barons, timber barons, and by the Babbits, who were in many enterprises including dry goods.  The Babitt name is still very prominent in AZ. ";
		public final String OAKCREEK = "Oak Creek Canyon is accessed by HWY 89A south of Flagstaff or north of Sedona.   The Canyon is about 12 mi long and ranges from 240 to 600 m deep. The west rim of the canyon is 200m higher than the east. Oak Creek, a tributary of the Verde River, carved the modern Oak Creek Canyon.  Oak Creek is one of the few perrnnial streams in the region and has long been used as a refuge from the hot dry climate. \n\n The first to seek refuge here came about 10,000 years ago.  These were the Nomadic-Paleo Indians.  Around Ad 700 the Hohokam (the vanished ones) were drawn here by the water and began to farm in the canyon. The Hohokam were followed by the Sinagua.  These groups mysteriously disappeared around 1300 AD.  The Apache and Yavapai were also drawn here by water and refuge from heat as were the settlers who came at the turn of the 20th Century. \n\n Zane Grey wrote his Novel the Call of the Canyon in Oak Creek.  In 1923 he convinced producer Jessy Lasky to film a movie based on the novel at the same site.  It was the first of Many Movies and Commercials that were filmed in Oak Creek Canyon.";

In 1982 they decided to sell the property, Governor Babbit suggested that the State buy the property for a park.  He worked with the Nature Conservancy, and they created The Arizona Parklands Foundation.  The final purchase price was around million. \n\n The famous feature of Course is the Natural sandstone water slid that drops into a pool of Oak Creek.  In the summer hundreds gather on the rocks to swim, sunbathe and beat the heat.  Slide rock is visible from the HWY if you look closely.";

The early settlers were farmers and ranchers who homesteaded along Oak Creek.  In 1902 when the post office was established there were only 55 residents. \n\n Sedona is named after Sedona Schnebly the wife of an early settler Carl Schnebly, who was also the first postmaster in the area.  The name came about when Carl was tired of having to travel long distance to get his mail.  He decided to apply to have a post office.  The name he first submitted was Schnebly Station.  It was promptly rejected as was the second proposal.  The names were too long to fit on the cancellation stamp used for letters.  A neighbor said why not your wifefs name gSedona.h  The post master general accepted the name and it has been the townfs name ever since.  The Schneblys left after their daughter was killed in a riding accident. \n\n Sedonafs history is short but interesting.  In the 50fs there were still less thatn 200 people in Sedona.  In the 60fs it became an art colony that also accommodated the occasional hippie.  In the 1970fs it exploded with retirees as an area warm but not as hot as Phoenix.  In the early 80fs Page Bryant, a famous psychic, claimed to have divined four metaphysical Vortices in the red rocks around Sedona.  Spiritualists and those seeking  the power of the vortex came to Sedona in droves.  In 1987 the Harmonic Convergence drew 5000 participants willing to pay $75 dollars to sit on Bell Rock the moment it was to depart for the Andromeda galaxy.  Since that time Sedona has been a New Age Mecca. \n\n Art still remains as Sedonafs prime industry (besides tourism).  There are well over 400 professional artists that live in Sedona, and many more if you include the surrounding area and the town of Jerome. \n\n Recently Sedona has become well know to people in Japan after the Celebrity Amuro Namie had a not so secret tryst with her lover, Jun Tamura (London Boots  no Jun) at LfAberge. \n\n Sedona has also been featured in Many movies, especially westerns.
