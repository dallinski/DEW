They would say gwe are going to Brycefs to cut wood g gradually the name became Bryce Canyon. \n\n Bryce is known for its diverse wildlife.  Although the most common animals seen are the mule deer and the wild turkey, Bryce is also home to Prairie Dogs, Cougars, badgers, weasels, ring tails and even a bear or two. \n\n The Flora is equally diverse in spite of the high elevation.  Plants range from the evening primrose and Manzanita, to ponderosa and even Bristlecone Pines. \n\n Bryce is also famous for its night sky.  Because Bryce is at a high elevation (2500m) and it is far from any major cities, the night sky is extremely clear and dark.  This provides for some of the best star gazing opportunities in the United States.  The gDark Rangersh frequently have night sky programs and star parties ant the visitors center.";
